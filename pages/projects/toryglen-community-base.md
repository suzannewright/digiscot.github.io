## Project plan

### Project description

IT suite refurbishment to support the development of Toryglen Digital Base and its work teaching basic computer skills in the community. This refurbishment will allow for more diverse digital courses within the Base and to broaden the service out to more of the community.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1 January 2015

Purchase and installation of equipment

### Phase 2 February 2015

Marketing of service including recruitment of participants.  Participants are able to participate in Basic IT, Intermediate IT, a job club as well as using the suite for drop in facilities.  

### Phase 3 February - July 2015

Ongoing use of facility to support training, digital skills clubs, job clubs and community access. This also involves further promotion to wider partnerships in order to raise awareness of this new updated facility.  This has led to groups such as Urban Roots using it for training their volunteers, WESREC running a specialised class over 55's BME clients and another Toryglen Community Group using it for the IT element of their reminiscince group.




## Evaluation

Use of questionnaires and discussions to monitor and evaluate current classes and identify further need.  Extending partnership working to bring on board more diverse digital courses.  This will include Digital Photography (June 15)  and Community Journalism (September 15) 

Much of the need for the access to IT facilites is due to having no local library and the local area.  The Glasgow indicators project states that Toryglen has a higher percentage of older people (aged 65 +) Lone parent households make up 51% and claimant rates for unemployment and disability benefits are higher than average.  These higher than average levels of deprivation has mean't that people have a great need for the computing suite and the learning to improve their IT skills.

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.
